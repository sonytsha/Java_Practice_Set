// shadowing in java - shadowing is basically a practice of using 2 variables with the same name within the scope that overlaps

 class Code_new_26 {
static int x = 90;// this will be shadowed at line 8 as the lower level is shadowing the upper level
public static void main ( String[] args) {
    System.out.println(x); // 90
    int x = 40; // the class variable at line 4 is shadowed by this
    System.out.println(x); // 40
    fun();

    /*  x = 40; // declaration
    System.out.println(x); -- this line will throw an error, if u try to access the variable before initializing it , it will throw error ..... scope will begin when the value is initialised
    x = 40; // initialization, now u can  print 
     */

    */
     */
}
static void fun() {
    System.out.println(x);
}
}
